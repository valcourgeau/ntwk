Description: It provides statistical inference tools for network time
    series, including implementation of the Graph OU (GrOU) model, sparse
    AR-like regression on irregularly-spaced data. It also handles jumps
    and LÃ©vy-type driving noises through Wiener-Poisson mixtures and
    Generalised Hyperbolic distributions.
