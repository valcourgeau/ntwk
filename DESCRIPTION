Description: It provides statistical inference tools for network time
    series, including implementation of the Graph OU (GrOU) model and
    sparse AR-like regression on irregularly-spaced data (Courgeau and
    Veraart (2020) <arXiv:2005.12720>; Courgeau and Veraart
    <arXiv:2008.10930>).  It also handles jumps and LÃ©vy-type driving
    noises through Wiener-Poisson mixtures and Generalised Hyperbolic
    distributions.
